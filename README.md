# Michelin Star Restaurants MongoDB

created by Sunwoo Kim and Elizabeth Odundo

## Project Description

The Michelin Star Restaurant database project coalesces data from three different sources (.csv files, API calls, and web scraping) and creates a non-relational database using MongoDB. The completed database contains three collections (one for each level of Michelin star ranking) and will hold the following information on each Michelin star restaurant: restaurant name, city, region, type of cuisine, url to website, nearest hotel/lodging, and specialty dishes.
